Paper Trading and Financial Learning Platform
Comprehensive Educational Platform Bridging Financial Theory With Practical Trading Experience Through Risk Free Simulation
Problem Statement

Many students are interested in financial markets and stock trading, but they face significant challenges while learning and practicing trading in real environments.

Major Challenges

Lack of practical trading exposure during learning

Students often learn only theory without hands on trading experience.

Risk of losing real money while experimenting in live markets

Beginners hesitate to practice due to financial risk.

Absence of a unified platform combining financial education and trading practice

Learning and execution are usually separated across different platforms.

Limited access to structured trading mentorship

Students struggle to find guided learning from experts.

Difficulty in tracking learning progress and trading performance

Most platforms do not provide integrated academic and performance analytics.

Study theoretical financial concepts without practice
